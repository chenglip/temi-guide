# Speech-to-Text Example

Example app used to test speech callback interfaces.

Note that in order for `OnConversationStatusChangedListener` to work correctly, the app must be selected as a Kiosk app.
See [documentation](https://github.com/robotemi/sdk/wiki/Speech#onconversationstatuschangedlistener) for details.
